    <h1>This is just a page I'm adding sterfff to because I need practice with git BOIII</h1>
    <h3>What is git you may be asking?</h3>
    <p>The best that I know about this sterfff, is that it's a distributed version control system (wow I think I said that right) that allows you to store projects remotely as well as working on projects with other people. There're so many gosh darn tootin steps to do the basics and it's not entirely intuitive, but hey, that's why I'm practicing right now!</p>
